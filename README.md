## How to run

3. Execute `IisLogRotator.exe` to compress or delete logfiles definitively

## How to install / schedule

If you need to execute the program daily and have reports to Windows Event Log,
you should register it to Windows Task Scheduler.

1. Execute `install.cmd` with Administrator rights
2. Modify scheduled task named `IIS Logs Rotation` manually if not satisfied with default settings (every day at 1:00 am UTC)
3. Enable scheduled task named `IIS Logs Rotation` manually, or execute `SCHTASKS /Change /TN "IIS Logs Rotation" /ENABLE`

## How to uninstall / unschedule

* To remove everything, execute `uninstall.cmd` with Administrator rights
* To disable the scheduled task, disable Windows scheduled task named `IIS Logs Rotation`, or execute `SCHTASKS /Change /TN "IIS Logs Rotation" /DISABLE`

## Settings

Open the `IisLogRotator.config` file with an XML-aware editor (like [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)) to avoid errors.

### Defaults

Default settings are set on the `/configuration/rotation/defaultsSettings` XML node.

Example for compression after 7 days, and deletion after 2 years :

```xml
<rotation>
	<defaultSettings compress="true" compressAfter="7" delete="true" deleteAfter="730"/>
</rotation>
```

### Site-specific settings

To specify site-specific settings, you have to find its service code and ID,
then add to your settings in a `siteSettings/siteSettings` node with the ID set to the `id` attribute.

Example for `W3SVC1` Website settings, to do deletion only after 30 days :

```xml
<rotation>
	<defaultSettings compress="true" compressAfter="7" delete="true" deleteAfter="730"/>
	<siteSettings>
		<siteSettings id="W3SVC1" compress="false" delete="true" deleteAfter="30"/>
	</siteSettings>
</rotation>
```

### `rotation` element allowed attribute values

| Attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `enableEventLog` | `true` to enable Windows event log reports or `false` (default) to disable |

Windows event logs reports are enabled when the program is installed using `install.cmd` and should not be enabled without,
or Windows will complain about missing event log source identifier.
